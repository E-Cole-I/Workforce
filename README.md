## Overview



Workforce for ArcGIS, developed by Esri, makes effectively managing a workforce an easy task. Connecting dispatchers and workers in a simplistic way with application across fields. This platform is aids in enabling decision making process to be more precise, efficient, and effective while carrying out field operations. More information on this application can be found by visiting the [Esri website](http://www.esri.com/products/workforce).
<br>
<br>
By integrating Workforce for ArcGIS with Python, several key functionalities can be automated. This will ultimately help to streamline the management of the workforce which will lead to a reduction of time and increased productivity. In this tutorial we will be stepping through an example of the allocation of workers spatially. Documentation and comments will break down each cell of code into easy understandable steps that can be applied into other forms of automation for workforce projects. Sample data for the project is available in ArcGIS Online and in the Github Repository.
