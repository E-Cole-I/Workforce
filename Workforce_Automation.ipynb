    "### Overview\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are going to be using Python and ArcGIS API for Python to automate a core workflow in Workforce for ArcGIS. Specifically, we are going to be importing a small workforce from a CSV and spatially assigning them assets to monitor. When working with large workforces, coordination may be difficult and time-consuming. By automating a major step of the process, people can reduce their time and increase their overall productivity.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Glacier National Park is a US National Park that spans across over one million acres. It is managed by the National Park Service, and there are over two million visitors annually. With the sheer size and amount of visitors to the park, there is a responsibility to maintain it to a high degree. With limited resources, effectively managing representatives of the park becomes essential. As part of this, preserving and protecting the quality of water is a fundamental mission of the National Park Service. In this example, a number of mock water sampling sites have been created across the park. Our objective is to efficiently and effectively assign these sites to a mock workforce to sample the sites across a summer to record the water quality at the park. With Workforce for ArcGIS, this task is made easy. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Even though Glacier National Park is being used as a test case to demonstrate the workflow, this script is easily adaptable to other large or small datasets. See input section for more information on datasets needed to run the script successfully. Once you feel comfortable with the Jupyter Notebook, feel free to adapt it to your data and more specialized workflows.\n",
    "\n",
